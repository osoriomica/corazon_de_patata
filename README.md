### Manual Testing
<strong>Manual testing</strong> involves checking a project‚Äôs functionality by simulating user interactions, typically through clicking buttons, filling out forms, and testing the logic and responsiveness in different browsers and resolutions. It is an essential way to ensure that a product meets the user's expectations but comes with limitations. It can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to human error,¬† making it unreliable (especially for larger projects). Tiredness, biases, and/or oversight can lead to missed bugs and issues that can dampen the user‚Äôs experience. Manual testing is best deployed when we need to assess the user experience (UX), or when testing specific user stories that require human judgment to evaluate nuances, which would not be picked by automated tests. 

<strong>Automated testing</strong>, on the other hand, uses code to run tests on software, providing a faster, scalable solution for detecting errors early in the development process. Automated tests can be written to target specific scenarios and run hundreds of tests in a short amount of time, making them ideal when verifying that new code hasn't broken existing functionality. However, automated tests are only as reliable as the test cases designed to check, and they do not assess the user experience. Therefore, a combination of manual and automated testing is often the best approach, where automated testing handles repetitive tasks and error detection; manual testing focuses on areas where human insight and user experience are critical. 

This site was thoroughly tested using a <strong>manual testing</strong> approach. These tests led to catching and fixing issues from early in the development. Some friends and family also contributed towards testing the game‚Äôs logic and provided valuable feedback. 

Please see below for the tests and final results:

Tested across:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile)
- All core views tested with both authenticated and guest users

| Feature          | Test Scenario                           | Result |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| Login Required   | Rating/commenting                        | Pass   |
| Valid/Invalid Rating | Rating value out of range check     | Pass   |
| Mobile UI        | Screen sizes < 768px                     | Pass   |
| Admin Panel      | CRUD operations                          | Pass   |
| Ratings           | Ratings persist across user sessions    | Pass   |
| Form validation | Comments and ratings are sent successfully | Pass |
| Message handling | Messages are displayed to the user on Post | Pass |

### Fixed Bugs

- **IntegrityError** during DB updates  
  Fix: `makemigrations` and `migrate` rerun after model adjustments  
- **Rating update** was duplicating entries  
  Fix: `get_or_create()` + `update()` logic in view  
- **AJAX errors** on unauthenticated users  
  Fix: Client-side check for auth before submitting via JS  
- **404 not styled**  
  Fix: Custom templates following [LearnDjango's tutorial](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/customizing-django-404-and-500-error-pages)
